# Hepatitis
	•	Developed a machine learning classification pipeline using Scikit-Learn to predict survival outcomes for hepatitis patients based on categorical and numeric features.
	•	Implemented and evaluated four classification models: Support Vector Machine (LinearSVC), Decision Tree, Random Forest, and K-Nearest Neighbors, comparing their performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
	•	Conducted hyperparameter tuning on the Random Forest classifier using Randomized Search, optimizing three key hyperparameters to improve prediction accuracy.
	•	Identified the top five most important features contributing to survival prediction using the feature_importances_ property of the Random Forest model.
	•	Built a stacking ensemble model using Multilayer Perceptron (MLPClassifier) as the meta-learner, combining predictions from all four classifiers to enhance predictive performance.
	•	Achieved performance improvements through model stacking and hyperparameter tuning, analyzing the impact on classification metrics.
	•	Utilized Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn), Google Colab, and statistical analysis techniques to refine model performance and feature selection.
